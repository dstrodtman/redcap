Dear {ename},<br>
<br>
This is just a sample script that demonstrates how you can pipe variables into a form email using the form_email.py script. Right now, there are only a handful of variables being defined, but the same type of logic used in the REDCap system can easily be implemented (right now, {your} is the only pronoun being set, and {ename} will be the first name of either the subject or parent, depending on whether or not sub is a child).  <a href="{link}">Here</a> is how you would link to someone survey queue. You can also use <a href="{unsubscribe}">this</a> to link to an individual survey--you'll just want to make sure you've selected the right one before exporting the survey links from REDCap (currently, the default survey is the 'Unsubscribe' survey, which is why this variable has this name.<br> 
<br>
You'll noticed that there is html markup for breaks at the end of each line. While this is a plaintext file, it will be pipe into an html wrapper once in python. The also means that markup like <b>bold</b> will work, should you want to use it.<br>
<br>
I'll just go ahead and leave my signature attached, as I figure that others will need similar formatting. <br>
<br>
Thank you for your time!<br>
