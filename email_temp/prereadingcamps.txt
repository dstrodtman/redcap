Dear {ename},<br>
<br>
The Reading & Dyslexia Research Program at the University of Washington is embarking on a new research project, and <b>we need your help</b>. Over the next year, we will be launching <b>pre-reading camps</b> for <b>4-5 year olds</b> prior to entering kindergarten. We will measure changes in letter knowledge, as well as changes in the brain using MEG and MRI prior to and after the camp. The first step is enrolling children of this age in our database. If you have children of this age range, or know families who might be interested in participating please spread the word. Interested parties can register at <a href="http://readinganddyslexia.com">ReadingAndDyslexia.com</a>. We appreciate your continued support of the Reading & Dyslexia Research Program.<br> 
<br>
Warmly<br>
Emily Kubota & Patrick Donnelly<br>
